  <h3>Clubs</h3>
  <p>These clubs are exactly what they sound like: clubs that are based on a shared interest in a subject. Depending on what you wish to major in, you could see if your high school has a related club.  If it doesn’t, you could look into starting one.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>American History Club</li>
    <li>History Club</li>
    <li>Military History Club</li>
    <li>Philosophy Club</li>
    <li>Political Science Club</li>
    <li>Mythology Club</li>
    <li>Psychology Club</li>
    <li>Renaissance Club</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Competitions</h2>
  <p>There are generally fewer competitions geared toward the social sciences than other disciplines, but participating in a general knowledge academic competition or an academic team can speak to an affinity for interdisciplinary study that would benefit any social science major.</p>

    <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h3>Academic Decathlon</h3>
  <p>Academic Decathlon is a national team competition comprising seven multiple choice tests, two subjective performance events, and an essay that require knowledge in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science, and social sciences. The decathlon is designed to include students from a range of achievement levels, making this a great extracurricular option if your GPA isn’t as high as you’d like as competition scores are based on GPA divisions.</p>
