  <h3>Clubs</h3>
  <p>The most obvious extracurricular activities are clubs. Not only do clubs provide a community of like-minded students, but they are easy to find and join when run through your school. Regular meetings and activities provide a consistent way for students to engage with their passions each week.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Astronomy Club</li>
    <li>Astrophysics Club</li>
    <li>Biochemistry Club</li>
    <li>Chemistry Club</li>
    <li>Earth Science Club</li>
    <li>Food Chemistry Club</li>
    <li>Future Scientists</li>
    <li>Oceanography Club</li>
    <li>Rocket Club</li>
    <li>Physics Club</li>

  <h2>Competitions</h2>
  <p>Science competitions for high schoolers come in two major forms: science olympiads and science fairs. 
<br>Olympiads are knowledge-based competitions where tests and challenges show your expertise in a subject. Here are the major Olympiads:</p>

    <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h3>Science Olympiad</h3>
  <p>Science Olympiad is a team-based competition where students compete in 23 events across various scientific fields. Subjects include Anatomy and Physiology, Forensics, Mechanical Engineering, and more. Succeeding in this competition demonstrates teamwork and quick-thinking skills.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h3>Chemistry Olympiad</h3>
  <p>Chemistry Olympiad is a science competition that focuses specifically on students’ knowledge of chemistry. Chemistry Olympiad is a series of exams, where the top qualifiers move on to the next round. If you love chemistry and excel at standardized tests, look into local exams being offered in your area.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h3>Physics Olympiad</h3>
  <p>Physics Olympiad is a science competition that involves a series of tests in physics subjects. There are two levels of exams, and the top twenty finishers of the second level exam go on to an intensive study camp and eventually represent the United States at the International Physics Olympiad. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h3>Science Fairs</h3>
  <p>While success in an Olympiad shows your breadth of knowledge within a scientific discipline, success in a science fair demonstrates an understanding of methods, the ability to master a nuanced issue, and the ability to follow through on your curiosity. 
<br>Science fairs range in size and prestige, from ones at your local school to national ones like the Google Science Fair. No matter what level you’re competing at, having a new and interesting scientific endeavor on your profile can help demonstrate where your interests lie as well as your capacity for innovation. Think hard about your topic and spend time on your research proposal to give your project its best shot.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="stem_clubs">
  <h2>Summer Programs</h2>
  <p>Summer programs come in many shapes and sizes. Prestigious programs are often free, and they sometimes even reward students for their work with a stipend. Some of the best programs include:</p>

    <div class="stem_comps_outer">
  <h3>Anson L. Clark Scholars Program</h3>
  <p>The Anson L. Clark Scholars Program is open to students in a wide range of fields, from biology to computer science to history. Students from across the globe travel to Texas Tech University where they are afforded the unique opportunity to gain hands-on research experience in their field while working one-on-one with faculty over the program’s seven intense weeks.
<br>Many Clark Scholars use the experience to shape their future college and career goals. The Clark Scholar Program is free for chosen applicants—the only cost students are responsible for is their transportation to and from the program. This program is open to high school juniors and seniors and is extremely selective; only 12 students are chosen each summer.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="stem_comps_outer">
  <h3>MIT Introduction to Technology, Engineering, and Science (MITES)</h3>
  <p>MITES is a residential program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aimed at students interested in pursuing a degree—and subsequently a career—in the STEM fields. Program participants are academically talented and come from diverse, underrepresented, or underserved backgrounds.
<br>Throughout this six-week residential program, high school juniors develop the skills necessary for success in STEM fields while learning about the value and reward of acquiring advanced technical degrees. MITES is free—the only expense students need to cover is their transportation to and from MIT.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stem_comps_outer">
  <h3>Research Science Institute (RSI)</h3>
  <p>The Research Science Institute gathers 100 of the world’s most outstanding high school students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a free, five-week program where they can experience the research cycle in its entirety. 
<br>Combining on-campus coursework in scientific theory with off-campus work in science and technology research, RSI students produce individual projects guided by experienced scientists and researchers, culminating in written and oral presentations of their projects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stem_comps_outer">
  <h3>Pre-College Programs</h3>
  <p>Many colleges and universities offer residential pre-college programs, where students stay in dorms together while taking a class for a few weeks during the summer. While these programs are usually not free and require students to pay tuition and housing, many offer the opportunity to earn college credits that can go on your college transcript. Popular programs include:</p>
